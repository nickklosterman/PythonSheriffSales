http://www.openjs.com/scripts/ui/calendar/
http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_calendar/ nice and simple. configure via css and js files
http://javascriptcalendar.org/javascript-date-picker.php another nice one. 
http://www.openjs.com/scripts/ui/calendar/ I wish I could get this one to work but it required some other files that I couldn't figuer out and wasn't sure how to configure or if they'd screw other stuff up. I liked that inside the calendar there were dropdowns for the M and Y so you could much more quickly move fwd and bwd in time
http://nogray.com/calendar.php haven't tried it but looks like it could be a standin for the one above. also has M and Y dropdowns for faster navigation
http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxCalendar/index.shtml another possible candidate that allows dimming of dates etc 
http://dev.base86.com/scripts/mootools_javascript_datepicker_calendar_eightysix.html#examples has nice features which include two fields where the second field always has to be one day after teh one selected in the previous field.
